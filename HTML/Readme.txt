
Mazel's All-In-One Search Page
------------------------------

I know there are many Web Search Pages out there and they're all good.
Problem is they're not all in one place. To do a good search, you have to jump
from one site to another. That's why I created my All-In-One Search for the
Web and Windows 95. The best of everything all on one page.

You can search for and download specific files in any or all categories.
(Filez). You can search specific popular search engines quick and easy.
You can submit your search to multiple engines at one time (DogPile).
You have access to many directories (Infospace) and regional newspapers
online (Erols).

To use it, simply put all the files into any folder and set your default
search page or a bookmark to search.html in the folder you installed the
files to.

This program is freeware and works with Microsoft's Internet Explorer and
Netscape's Navigator. 

Enjoy!
